# Gaeul

Chamge[tʃɑmge] is a small crab in Korean and this module aims to provide control channel
to the SRT relay server([hwangsae](https://github.com/hwangsaeul/hwangsae)) and 
Edge([gaeguli](https://github.com/hwangsaeul/gaeguli)).

This software is an [AMQP](https://www.rabbitmq.com/protocols.html#amqp-091) client
to gather information about edge and will instanciate the SRT relay on demand
according to the current load.

## Overview

### Broker types
There are three modules for connection broker API. Theses module's states are enrolled, activated, deactivated, delisted.

#### Edge
Edge is a connection broker module for srt source devices. 

#### Arbiter
Arbiter is a connection broker module for srt management servers.

#### Hub
Hub is a connection broker module for srt relay servers.

### Agents
Role of agents are for communicating with another process. Agents include D-BUS api that is created by code generater from defined xml in the path of chamge/dbus/. Manager server's RESET Api communicate with Arbiter via D-BUS(chamge-arbiter-agent).

## Build from sources
To build the from sources follow the procedure described in

[Build from sources](https://github.com/hwangsaeul/hwangsaeul.github.io/blob/master/build_from_sources.md)

## Run

### Examples
There are dummy files in examples folder. These are helper examples to implement edge/hub/arbiter.

#### Test Sequence of examples
1. Run arbiter-dummy : Arbiter's status will go to activated status automatically. It will wait for the messages from edge/hub to enroll/activate.
2. Run edge-dummy/hub-dummy : It will send enroll/activate to arbiter-dummy, and will be activated status after get response from arbiter-dummy.
3. Input user-command : arbiter-dummy will send the sample user command according to user's key input. If you want to check what kind command you can use, try "h".
